# recommender_engines
A private libary for training all kinds of recommender systems. 
Contains:
- Content Filtering
- Factorization Machines
- Feature Engineering (various methods for creating feature embedding vectors)
- Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Armed Bandits and Bayesian Multi-Armed Bandits)

Coming soon:
- Deep Factorization Machines (a Deep Hybrid Recommender system similar to the FM)
- Feature Engineering - VAE in pytorch 
_ Deep Hybrid Recommender system using Vampire

- User-based and Item-based Collaborative Filtering
  * Nearest neighbors approach
  * Matrix decomposition by gradient descent
  * Nonnegative matrix factroization
  * Probabalistic Matrix Factorization
  * Deep Collaborative Filtering with autoencoders

- Association rules
- Deep outfits. ("pairs well with")
- "Describe what you are looking" for bot - Information retrieval (cosine sim with document embeddings. take in any type of document embeddings) (This is the same as content, but it uses sentiment)
- LDA recommender system
 - Q learning recommender
